# Django AI Agent Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate Django with LangGraph to build powerful AI agents, incorporating robust access control with Permit.io. Django serves as the data backend, LangGraph orchestrates the AI agents, and Permit.io provides essential guardrails for data safety and access management.

## Key Features & Tech Stack

- ✅ **Minimal Overhead User Data**: Efficiently save user data with minimal overhead.
- ✅ **Data Interaction**: Seamlessly interact with the data you or your users care about.
- ✅ **Third-Party API Integration**: Easily integrate third-party REST API services.
- ✅ **Python Functions as AI Tools**: Turn any Python functions into tools that an AI Agent can run with natural language queries (e.g., "what are my recent documents?" or "What new movies are out?").
- ✅ **Django ORM Chat**: Chat with Django User data using standard Django queries, without the need for vector embeddings (though they can be used).
- ✅ **LLM Flexibility**: Easily switch Large Language Models (LLMs) to upgrade the effectiveness of your agents.
- ✅ **RBAC with Permit.io**: Leverage Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within any Django or Python project using Permit.io.
- ✅ **Supervisor Agents**: Create a Super(visor) Agent that controls other agents.
- ✅ **Access Control**: Lock down access to what a User can or cannot do.
- ✅ **Agent Guardrails**: Add guardrails to ensure an Agent can't perform unauthorized actions (e.g., create, update, read, search, list, share, or delete any data).
- ✅ **Extensible**: And much more.
