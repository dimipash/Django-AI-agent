# Django AI Agent Project

This project provides a complete implementation of Django integrated with LangGraph to build powerful AI agents, incorporating robust access control with Permit.io. Django serves as the data backend, LangGraph orchestrates the AI agents, and Permit.io provides essential guardrails for data safety and access management.

## Project Completion
✅ All planned features implemented  
✅ Notebook tutorials completed  
✅ Production-ready codebase  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  

## Key Features & Tech Stack

- ✅ **Minimal Overhead User Data**: Efficiently save user data with minimal overhead.
- ✅ **Data Interaction**: Seamlessly interact with the data you or your users care about.
- ✅ **Third-Party API Integration**: Easily integrate third-party REST API services.
- ✅ **Python Functions as AI Tools**: Turn any Python functions into tools that an AI Agent can run with natural language queries.
- ✅ **Django ORM Chat**: Chat with Django User data using standard Django queries.
- ✅ **LLM Flexibility**: Easily switch Large Language Models (LLMs).
- ✅ **RBAC with Permit.io**: Leverage Role-Based Access Control within any Django project.
- ✅ **Supervisor Agents**: Create a Super(visor) Agent that controls other agents.
- ✅ **Access Control**: Lock down access to what a User can or cannot do.
- ✅ **Agent Guardrails**: Ensure agents can't perform unauthorized actions.
- ✅ **Extensible Architecture**: Ready for future expansion.
